This repo is a simple sandbox for experimenting with TypeScript. While it doesn't currently use the most optimal solution for compiling and managing code. it will do for now.

### To Compile:

```bash
$> npx tsc
```

### To Compile (For DEV):

```bash
$> npx tsc --watch
```

Compiled code will be located in ./output/[FILENAME].js. You can either serve the `index.html` file via a server or open it directly in your browser.
